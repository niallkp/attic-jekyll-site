# Apache Attic Website

This is the source code for the website at [attic.apache.org](https://attic.apache.org)
which manages ASF projects which have retired.

This site uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), which is a static site generator.
See the [Jekyll Website](https://jekyllrb.com/) on how to install Jekyll and build this
site locally.

## TODO
This Poc is functional but there are a number of tasks remaining:
  - Create data files for all Attic projects (currently only 13 are done)
  - Fix the Look & Feel
    - currently using the default Jekyll **Minima** theme
    - need to decide how the website should look and fix the page layout and how it looks
    - add standard "Apache" links
  - Decide whether the **flag** functionality should be included
  - decide what to do about **revived** projects. From what I can see only
    **XMLBeans** & **Ambari** have been revived. We don't include Ambari but we
    have a page for XMLBeans (I think we don't bother with them)
  - Add script to generate _data/projects/<project>.yaml file from project id.
    Could this be a GHA that creates a PR?
    (I think any automatically created content needs to be reviewed before deployment)


## Overview

The [Attic Website](https://attic.apache.org) is composed of the following:

  - Simple `markdown` pages such as the _home_ (`index.md`) and _Process_ (`process.md`) pages.
  - A `yaml` file for each project in the `_data/projects` directory which contains all the
    details about the project and its retirement
  - The _Process Tracking_ (`tracking.md`) page which generates a table showing the status of each
    project generated from the files in `_data/projects' directory.
  - [Jekyll Plugins](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/) which generate pages and files for the
    retired projects from the files in `_data/projects' directory:
    - `_plugins/projects-plugin.rb` generates the [project pages](https://attic.apache.org/projects/)
      from the project's `yaml` data file.
    - `_plugins/attic-banner-plugin.rb` generates a _flag_ file to indicate that the _Attic Banner_
      should be added to a project's website (based on the project's `yaml` data file).
    - `_plugins/cwiki-banner-plugin.rb` generates a _flag_ file to indicate that the _Attic Banner_
      should be added to the project's CWIKI spaces (based on the project's `yaml` data file).

## Project YAML Data File

The project YAML files contain the following information in order to generate the project pages:
  - **Retirement Date** (usually the date of the board meeting the project was terminated)
  - **JIRA ID** of the ticket used to track the project's move to the Attic
  - **Completion Date** of the project's move to the Attic
  - **Project Description**
  - **Source Code** repositorie(s)
  - **Mailing Lists**
  - **Issue Tracker(s)**
  - **Wiki** space(s)
  - **Download Details**
  - **Related Projects**

Creating/Updating a project's YAML file updates the project page, updates the Tracking page
and generates any required flags for the project's website and wiki.

The structure of the project YAML file is shown below:

```yaml
