<h4>JIRA Template</h4>

<p>
Use the markup below to create a JIRA for the project's move to the Attic:
</p>

<pre>
{%- if page.board_resolution == true %}
# Confirm [Board Resolution|{{ resolution_locn }}] (!)
{%- else %}
# Confirm Board Resolution (!)
{%- endif %}
# Create the project YAML data file in the [_data/projects|https://github.com/apache/attic/tree/main/_data/projects] directory in the Attic site. (!)
# Ensure the: [attic.apache.org/projects/{{ page.project_id }}|https://attic.apache.org/projects/{{ page.project_id }}.html] page has been generated(!)
# Inform [dev|https://lists.apache.org/thread/xxxxxxxxxx] of the move to the Attic (!) 
# Ensure [original project site|http://{{ project_domain }}/] pages carry the Attic banner (!)
{%- if page.wiki.type and page.wiki.type == "CWIKI" %}
# Ensure the Wiki pages (see links on the [{{ page.project_id }}|https://attic.apache.org/projects/{{ page.project_id }}.html] page) carry the Attic banner (!)
{%- endif %}
# Update the project DOAP file (if any) or copy to [projects-override|https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/comdev/projects.apache.org/trunk/data/projects-override/]: (!)
# Get infra lock down project's resources (!)
# Announce on [announce at apache.org|http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/www-announce/] (!)

See [http://attic.apache.org/process.html#howto] for detailed instructions
</pre>

<h4>User Email Template</h4>

<p>
Let the users know that the PMC is moving into the Attic. Use the following text:
</p>

<pre>
A heads up for the {{ project_name }} user community that the {{ project_name }}  PMC has
been 'moved to the Attic'. This means that the {{ project_name }}  developers (more
formally its Project Management Committee) have voted to retire {{ project_name }} 
and move the responsibility for its oversight over to the Attic project.

Loosely speaking this means that the projects resources will be moved to a
read-only state.

You can read more about the Apache Attic and the process of moving to the
Attic at https://attic.apache.org.

You can follow this process in JIRA:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/{{ page.attic_issue }}

Thanks,

${NAME}
on behalf of {{project_name}} project and the Apache Attic.
</pre>

<h4>Announcement Email Template</h4>

<p>
Consider the following template when announcing that the project is now retired:
</p>

<pre>
Announcing that the {{project_longname}} committers have voted to retire
the project due to inactivity. {{page.description}}.

Retiring a project is not as simple as turning everything off, as
existing users need to both know that the project is retiring and
retain access to the necessary information for their own development
efforts.

You can read more about {{project_name}}'s retirement at:

   https://attic.apache.org/projects/{{page.project_id}}.html

The project's resources will continue to be available in a read-only state -
website, mailing lists, wikis, git, downloads and bug tracker with no 
change in url.

Providing process and solutions to make it clear when an Apache
project has reached its end of life is the role of the Apache Attic,
and you can read more about that at:

   https://attic.apache.org/

Thanks,

${NAME}
on behalf of the Apache Attic and the now retired {{project_name}} project
</pre>
